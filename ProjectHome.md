AnyTag allows you to map any URL to any read only NFC tag you already have.
AnyTag allows you to link any NFC tag to any URL. You might have tags that already have content written to it you can't change. Using this app, you can map it to another URL.

Some Android apps detect URLs and can open the contents themselves. Example: the mobile web address of a Foursquare venue can open the venue in the Foursquare app. Linking your tag to that address will allow you to do a checkin straight from a NFC tag. How cool is that?
